<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
  Data validation and type checking (supposedly) make for more correct code.
  And faster code too, sometimes.
  And, in rare cases, code that's easier to follow than the un-checked one.
  Unfortunately, Scheme does not have many (type-)checking primitives out of the box.
  This SRFI provides some, with the aim of allowing more performant and correct code with minimum effort on the user side.
  Both (manual) argument checking/validation (<a href="#spec--check-arg"><code>check-arg</code></a>)
  and return value(s) (<a href="#spec--values-checked"><code>values-checked</code></a>) checking/coercion are provided.
  Syntax sugar like <a href="#spec--lambda-checked"><code>lambda-checked</code></a>
  and <a href="#spec--define-checked"><code>define-checked</code></a> is added on top.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>
  Many Scheme code bases grow to a certain point.
  A point where entropy creates too diverse of an input set to ignore.
  That's where most programmers turn to contracts (in a loose sense of the word) and data validation.
  Other languages have type systems, object-orientation, type polymorphism, and other systems establishing code contracts.
  Scheme doesn't.
</p>
<p>
  Scheme programs often grow a set of validation utilities.
  Be it for correctness (reliable data structure libraries, foreign function interfaces.)
  Or for speed (game engines, numeric libraries.)
  These utils come in many shapes and implementations, but they can be split into several groups:
</p>

<ol>
  <li id="use-case-1"> Argument/data validation.
  <li id="use-case-2"> Value coercion.
  <li id="use-case-3"> Function/value type declaration.
  <li id="use-case-4"> Type/property/predicate dispatching.
</ol>

<p>
  Implementations cater to these needs and cases, providing special forms/macros, usually for type declaration.
  The syntax and semantics of these differ wildly, though.
  If one wants to write correct, strongly typed, or performant code, one is stuck with non-portable APIs.
  Thus the need for standardization—one needs portable ways to ensure code validity/strictness.
</p>
<p>
  SRFIs most closely related to this one (and their differences) are:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-145">SRFI-145 (assume)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    One of the cited reasons for <code>assume</code> is performance gains.
    Which is consistent with this SRFI.
    The difference is the scope—this SRFI provides primitives covering most categories above.
    While <code>assume</code> is exclusively restricted to generic condition checking <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
    And practical use of <code>assume</code> is too wordy, a more inlined syntax (like <code>lambda-checked</code>) never hurts.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-187">SRFI-187 (alambda)</a> and the like</dt>
  <dd>
    A withdrawn family of SRFIs, the only ones bearing the "Type Checking" category.
    Fully covering the case of data validation and are good at establishing contracts in general.
    A few (minor) flaws: they're withdrawn; and the scope of the alambda SRFI is explicitly wider than type checking, mostly focusing on procedure arguments <a href="#use-case-1">(3)</a> in general.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  See the <a href="#prior-art">Prior art</a> section for more references and context.
</p>

<p>
  This SRFI is novel in that it introduces a set of primitives explicitly geared for predicate/type checking.
  It is designed so that implementations can turn these primitives into cheap and strong type checks if need be.
  (The sample implementation already includes multiple implementation-specific optimizations, which proves the point.)
  No other goal is pursued but allowing more correct, strict, and optimized Scheme code.
</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>
  Provided APIs can conceptually be split into two parts: basic and derived.
  (The distinction won't be reflected in this section structure, but should be trivial to guess.)
  Derived APIs are merely a syntactic sugar over basic primitives, but they are too useful for everyday programming to be left out.
  They also mirror the way some implementations handle typing/contracts at the procedure level.
  This solidifies the existing practice, making it convenient to reproduce.
</p>

<p id="it-is-an-error">
  It is recommended that implementations actually throw checking errors in all the "it is an error" cases below.
  At least in debug mode.
  The possible type of error might be <code>&amp;assertion</code>.
  Implementations are free to follow the original permissive "it is an error" behavior whenever deemed necessary, though.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a> is explicitly not covered by this SRFI.
  See <a href="#design--match-over-check-case">(Design decisions) match&amp;predicates > check-case</a> for why.
</p>

<h3 id="spec--check-arg">(check-arg predicate value . args)</h3>

<p>
  Guarantees that the <code>value</code> (evaluated) conforms to the <code>predicate</code> (evaluated).
  Implementations can enforce the predicate check in all the code that follows, but are not required to.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if <code>predicate</code> returns <code>#f</code> when called on <code>value</code>.
  Otherwise, returns non-false value.
  Implementations may use <code>args</code> in any non-portable way, but are advised to follow the convention of passing the who/caller as third argument.
</p>

<p>
  One possible implementation, as found in SRFI-1, might be:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define (check-arg pred val caller)
  (let lp ((val val))
    (if (pred val) val (lp (error "Bad argument" val pred caller)))))
</pre>

<p>
  The sample implementation defines <code>check-arg</code> as a macro
  (see <a href="#design--check-arg">(Design decisions) check-arg—procedure or macro?</a>),
  but there's no reason it can't be a procedure instead.
</p>

<p>
  Inspired by Common Lisp <code>check-type</code> special form.
</p>

<h3 id="spec--values-checked">(values-checked (predicates ...) values ...)</h3>

<p>
  Guarantees that the <code>values</code> (evaluated) abide by the given <code>predicates</code> (evaluated)
  (the number of values and predicates should match) and returns them as multiple values.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if any of the <code>predicates</code> returned false.
  Implementations may choose to coerce the values when the types are compatible (e.g. integer -> inexact).
  Supports multiple values:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(values-checked (integer?) 9) ;; Single value
(values-checked (integer? string?) 9 "hello") ;; Multiple values
(values-checked (integer? real? char?) 9 83.12 #\a) ;; More values
(values-checked (integer?) 9.0) ;; 9 or 9.0
(values-checked (string?) 9) ;; => unspecified, is an error
</pre>

<p>
  Notice that single value form still has the parentheses around the only predicate.
  This is to avoid ambiguity.
  Implementations must not omit parentheses.
  If presence of parens was a marker for multiple values, then more complex predicate would break it:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(values-checked (cut = <> 3) 9) ;; Uh oh, we need parentheses after all!
</pre>

<p>
  <code>values-checked</code> is inspired by Common Lisp <code>the</code> special form
  (you can already see the author comes from Common Lisp world,)
  declaring the unambiguous type for the return value.
  The same inspiration can be traced in some Scheme implementations, like Chicken
  (see <a href="#prior--implementations">(Prior Art) Implementations</a>).
</p>

<h3 id="spec--lambda-checked">(lambda-checked (args ...) body ...)</h3>

<p>
  A regular lambda, but with any argument (except the rest argument) optionally having the form <code>(name predicate)</code>
  (as compared to default single-symbol form).
  Arguments of this extended form are guaranteed to satisfy the respective (evaluated) <code>predicate</code>.
  At least on procedure application time.
  This guarantee might be extended for all the procedure body, including for any modification and shadowing, at implementors' will.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if either of the arguments does not satisfy the predicate.
</p>

<pre role=code>
;; See <a href="#implementation--caveat-rest-arg">(Implementation) Caveat: Rest Argument Support Is Uneven</a> for the caveats of using . rest pattern.
(define error
  (lambda-checked ((who symbol?) (message string?) . irritants)
    ...))
</pre>

<h3 id="spec--case-lambda-checked">(case-lambda-checked ((args ...) body ...) ...)</h3>

<p>
  Same as <code>case-lambda</code>, but with any argument taking a form of <code>(name predicate)</code> to be checked.
  See <a href="#spec--lambda-checked">lambda-checked</a> section for other details.
</p>

<h3 id="spec--opt-lambda-checked">(opt-lambda-checked (args ...) body ...)</h3>

<p>
  Defined in case <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-227">SRFI-227</a> is accessible.
  Same as <code>opt-lambda</code>, but every optional argument with a specified value can also specify a predicate to check it with.
  (<a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if the check if unsuccessful.)
  The respective argument form is <code>(name default-value predicate)</code>.
  Only the optionals with default value can have predicates (to avoid ambiguity.)
  See <a href="#spec--lambda-checked">lambda-checked</a> section for other details.
</p>

<p>
  An additional <code>define-optionals-checked</code> is provided, equivalent to:
</p>

<pre role=code>
  (define name (opt-lambda-checked (arg ...) body ...))
</pre>

<h3 id="spec--define-checked">(define-checked (name args ...) body ...) | (define-checked name predicate value)</h3>

<p>
  Defines a procedure or variable satisfying the given predicates.
  For procedures, effectively equal to <code>define+lambda-checked</code>:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define-checked (error (who symbol?) (message string?) . irritants)
  ...)
</pre>

<p>
  For variables, checks the <code>value</code> (and, if implementation supports that, all the subsequent modifications) for the <code>predicate</code> match.
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define-checked message string? "Hi!")
</pre>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
  Sample implementation is done in standard syntax-rules, which makes it fairly portable
  (<a href="#design--minimalist">and minimalist</a>.)
  Chicken, Kawa, STklos, and Gauche-specific definitions with stronger typing/checking are also provided as <code>cond-expand</code>-s.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="srfi/impl.scm">Source for the portable sample implementation.</a>
  See the <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-253">SRFI repository</a>
  for other useful files.
</p>

<p>
  Tested at least on
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Guile: full support
  <li> Kawa: full support, <code>values-checked</code> coerces values whenever possible
  <li> STklos: full support
  <li> Chicken: partial support, with type checking only working in compile-time and rest argument support missing.
  <li> Gauche: partial support:
    <ul>
      <li> Rest arguments are not supported.
      <li> <code>check-arg</code> shadows the syntax provided by <code>(gauche base)</code>...
      <li>... and makes additional type checks with Gauche object system.
      <li> No SRFI-227 support yet.
    </ul>
  <li> Gambit and Gerbil: broken, undebugged due to insufficient understanding of the implementation
</ul>

<h3 id="implementation--caveat-rest-arg">Caveat: Rest Argument Support Is Uneven</h3>

<p>
  Significant limitation: sample implementation does not support rest arguments in <code>lambda-checked</code> and other lambda macros <em>on some implementations</em>.
  Notably Chicken and Gauche, because these don't allow rest pattern in macros.
  Sample implementation should seamlessly support rest arguments on implementations allowing them.
</p>

<h2 id="design">Design Decisions</h2>

<h3 id="design--performance-vs-correctness">Performance vs. correctness</h3>

<p>
  Checks might be used for performance or correctness.
  Sometimes these two motives oppose each other.
  More performant code would only like to know the number is IEEE double,
  while more correct code would need a number in a [1.0,49.3] range.
  This SRFI tries to find a middle ground: being minimalist about the check specs (single predicates)
  so that performance optimizations are possible for a certain known range of types;
  all the while allowing any predicate or a combination thereof,
  so that the ones seeking correctness of their code find it in this SRFI.
</p>

<h3 id="design--minimalist">Minimalist implementation</h3>

<p>
  The implementation is portable <code>syntax-rules</code> macros.
  This puts limitations on the power of the provided macros.
  But it's better to have minimalist yet portable SRFI than an implementation-specific kitchen sink.
  Implementation-specific kitchen sinks will be there anyway, no use in chasing them.
  What matters is establishing a baseline for (type-)checked procedures and primitives.
</p>

<h3 id="design--check-arg">check-arg—procedure or macro?</h3>

<p>
  Most SRFIs that use <code>check-arg</code> (1, 13, 44, 152) define it as a procedure.
  This library defines it as a macro.
  Mostly to reuse more optimizable <code>assert</code>/<code>assume</code> underneath.
  Implementations are free to make it a function.
  That's why there's a <code>. rest</code> argument in <code>check-arg</code>—it's intended for extension.
  And that's why <code>check-arg</code> reliant primitives pass their names into <code>check-arg</code>.
  To make implementation's work easier.
</p>

<h3 id="design--why-check-arg">Why even include check-arg if there are assert/assume?</h3>

<p>
  <code>check-arg</code> is included for completeness and consistency of the SRFI.
  And to highlight the existing practice.
  (Gauche even has its own <code>check-arg</code> that this SRFI catches up to!)
  It's also expected that check-arg will be easier to optimize for simple predicate case than more generic <code>assert</code>/<code>assume</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="design--match-over-check-case">match&amp;predicates > check-case</h3>

<p>
  An earlier sample implementation contained <code>check-case</code> primitive, matching the data by predicates.
  This macro doesn't belong here, though.
  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-241">SRFI-241</a> and all the practice preceding it already have a way to match predicates.
  So one only has to use SRFI-241, Wright-Cartwright-Shinn, or implementation-provided <code>match</code> macros to get Common Lisp <code>typecase</code> behavior <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a>.
  And some implementations (like Racket) already optimize/type-check this use-case, so no need for specialized construct.
</p>

<p>
  Here's how the type/check-matching incantation might look like (in Wright-Cartwright-Shinn implementation):
</p>
<pre role=code>
(match x
  ((? integer? x) (+ 1 x))
  ((? string? x) (+ 1 (string->number x)))
  (_ (error "Not the right type")))
</pre>

<h3 id="design--removal-of-let-checked">Removal of let-checked</h3>

<p>
  Previously defined (drafts 1 and 2) <code>let-checked</code> was removed in draft 3.
  For the same reason this SRFI and SRFI-187 differ—this one is checking-only.
  <code>let-checked</code> had too much features for questionable benefit.
  And there was no implementation-specific constructs
  (except Chicken's <code>assume</code>,
  but it is explicitly marked as an equivalent of <code>let</code> + <code>the</code>
  (equivalent to <code>values-checked</code> of this SRFI))
  to serve as a back-end for it.
</p>

<h3 id="design--union-types">Union/intersection/etc. Types</h3>

<p>
  There's no union/intersection/exclusion types built into the library.
  These require hard-coding them in every macro, and there's always a question of where to stop adding these new types
  (do we need "list-of" type? "every" type? "sequence-of"? nested record types?)
  It's also non-trivial to handle the nested types like <code>(and number? (not integer?))</code> in <code>syntax-rules</code>
  (see the <a href="#design--minimalist">(Design decisions) Minimalist implementation</a> part above)
  Given that Scheme type checks are predicate-based,
  one can use <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-235">SRFI-235</a> combinators
  (like <code>disjoin</code> or <code>conjoin</code>) or define their own to have custom union type anyway.
  Member and equality types are simple enough to not need special syntax at all.
  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-26">SRFI-26</a> could work just fine for this:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(check-arg (cut memv <> '(1 2 3)) argument)
(check-arg (cut eq? <> 'foo) argument)
</pre>

<p>
  This approach of not having union etc. checks makes implementation-specific optimizations harder.
  But implementations like Guile already optimize based on <code>assert</code> and code path analysis.
  Additional indirection function is optimizable enough.
  Especially so in the context of the primitives this library provides.
  Implementations may provide more optimized combinators (say, <code>check-or</code>) on top of this library.
</p>

<h3 id="design--err-or-not">To Err or Not to Err</h3>

<p>
  <code>check-arg</code> and other primitives use SRFI-145 <code>assume</code> instead of standard <code>assert</code> whenever possible.
  <code>assume</code> is more strict than <code>assert</code>, erroring in more cases.
  Which highlights an important design decision: it's better to error more.
  Errors highlight the broken contract, which is useful in development, prompting contract/code refinement.
  And contract violations that happen at runtime can potentially break a lot.
  That's why <code>check-arg</code> uses <code>assume</code>.
  It's better to err than break silently.
</p>

<h3 id="design--type-checking-rest">Type-checking . rest arg in lambda-checked</h3>

<p>
  One useful reference is Common Lisp: it allows annotating the <code>&amp;rest</code> argument with its element types.
  Probably what any <code>&amp;rest</code> argument user wants.
</p>

<pre role=code>
(declare (ftype (function (number &amp;rest number) number) +))
</pre>

<p>
  Such a feature is omitted from this SRFI (although implementations might add it if they wish to.)
  Both because it's not trivial to implement
  and because it asks for a "list-of" primitive
  (see <a href="#design--union-types">(Design Decisions) Union/intersection/etc. Types</a>),
  which is a non-goal complexity level.
</p>

<h3 id="design--prefix-postfix-types">Prefix or postfix types?</h3>

<p>
  This SRFI uses postfix types in derived macros like <code>lambda-checked</code> and <code>define-checked</code>.
  Which is in contrast to languages like C, where types are (mostly) prefix.
  The choice is subjective, but also consistent with what other Lisps tend to do.
  Common Lisp <code>defmethod</code> specifiers come after variable name.
  In general, optional/special data comes after the argument name in procedure definition in most Lisps.
  And modern C-family languages like Rust and Go embrace postfix types too.
  More natural to read this way.
  Name first, auxiliary information last.
</p>

<p>
  Inconsistently enough, <code>check-arg</code> and <code>values-checked</code> put predicates/types first.
  The heuristic here might be that names go before predicates (as in <code>lambda-checked</code> args,)
  while predicates go before values (as in <code>values-checked</code>.)
  Given that some of the provided primitives don't reference names, predicates go first, followed by values.
</p>

<h2 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h2>

<p>
  This section is mostly a result of review of all the accessible SRFIs.
  (At the moment of writing, 0-252.)
  And, occasionally, implementation manuals and (mostly Guile-based) real-world programs.
  There are emergent patterns worth optimizing, and that's what this SRFI does.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--conditionals">Guarding conditionals</h3>

<p>
  The code only accepts certain types of things.
  The simplest way to ensure that the arguments are the right type of things is to check.
  Which is what <code>cond</code> is for:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(cond
 ((integer? x) (+ 1 x))
 ((string? x) (+ 1 (string->number x)))
 (else ???))
</pre>

<p>
  This pattern has two problems:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> One needs to list out all the conditions and potentially duplicate code.
  <li> It's not clear what to do when none of the conditions are satisfied.
</ul>

<h3 id="prior--check-x">Ad hoc checks: check-*</h3>

<p>
  One obvious action on data mismatch is to raise an error.
  That's what the conventional <code>check-*</code> procedures tend to do.
  Check that conditions are satisfied and error out if they don't <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
  Something like what SRFI-144 does:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define (check-flonum! name x)
  (if (not (flonum? x))
      (error (string-append "non-flonum argument passed to "
                            (symbol->string name))
             x)))
</pre>

<p>
  The benefit of this pattern is that one can put a single <code>check-*</code> form at the start of the procedure and be done with it (SRFI-144 again):
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define (flop1 name op)
  (lambda (x)
    (check-flonum! name x)
    (let ((result (op x)))
      (if (not (flonum? result))
          (error (string-append "non-flonum result from "
                                (symbol->string name))
                 result))
      result)))
</pre>

<p>
  The most prevalent example of this strategy is the <code>check-arg</code>, giving the name to one of the primitives in this SRFI.
  It's present in SRFI-1, SRFI-13, SRFI-44, SRFI-152, and likely some others.
  The canonical implementation (as found in SRFI-1) is
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define (check-arg pred val caller)
  (let lp ((val val))
    (if (pred val) val (lp (error "Bad argument" val pred caller)))))
</pre>

<h3 id="prior--coercion-ensure">Coercion: ensure-*</h3>

<p>
  Another strategy of dealing with malformed data is trying to coerce/fix it <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>.
  That's what conventional <code>ensure-*</code> functions do:
</p>

<pre role=code>
;; SRFI-175
(define (ensure-int x) (if (char? x) (char->integer x) x))
</pre>

<p>
  The benefit of the approach is that one is always certain the data is well-formed.
  Well, to a certain extent.
  Some data is too broken to be coerced, which raises a need for checking and erroring out.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--assume-assert">SRFI-145 (assume) and R6RS (assert)</h3>

<p>
  Another way to check that things are in order <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a> is using the R<sup>6</sup>RS <code>assert</code> or SRFI-145 <code>assume</code>.
  Primitives allowing to check whether the given expression is true and error out if it isn't.
  Same as <code>check-*</code> procedures, but more generic.
</p>

<p>
  <code>assume</code>, in particular, is used in at least 9 SRFIs.
  Mostly to do simple predicate checks.
  Which highlights the need for predicate-checking primitive.
  Maybe even the one tuned for performance, because performance is one of the motivations behind <code>assume</code> SRFI.
</p>

<p>
  One problem with <code>assume</code> is that it gets too verbose at times.
  To the point of being longer than the actual function body.
  Take this example from SRFI-214:
</p>

<pre role=code>
(define (flexvector-ref fv index)
  (assume (flexvector? fv))
  (assume (integer? index))
  (assume (< -1 index (flexvector-length fv)))
  (vector-ref (vec fv) index))
</pre>

<p>
  So one needs some shorter (likely inlined in the procedure definition) way to provide types/predicates.
  Otherwise it&#39;s too much visual clutter.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--implementations">Implementation-specific (typing) primitives</h3>

<p>
  Most big implementations caring for performance or correctness provide typing/checking APIs.
  The problem of <code>assume</code> verbosity from the previous section is solved at least by Bigloo, Chicken, Gambit/Gerbil, Kawa, and Typed Racket.
  Either through inline types in procedure definition
</p>

<pre role=code>
;; Kawa/Bigloo
(define (a x::integer)
  x)
;; Gambit
(define-procedure (a (x integer))
  x)
;; Typed Racket
(define a (lambda ([x : Integer]) x))
</pre>

<p>
  or through the separate declaration forms
</p>

<pre role=code>
;; Chicken
(: a (integer -> integer))
;; Typed Racket
(: a (-> Integer Integer))
</pre>

<p>
  With these ways to check procedures <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a> for types (and sometimes predicates, with custom types some implementations provide) one gets 90% there.
  Procedures are almost all there is to Scheme, after all.
</p>
<p>
  But some implementations aim for more, rivaling systems like Common Lisp or even statically typed languages.
  Chicken provides <code>the</code> for return type checking <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>, and Kawa provides <code>as</code>, which additionally coerces the values whenever possible.
  Chicken also has the <code>assume</code> form (not to be confused with SRFI-145) , which pins the variables to types for the duration of the body <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
  Chicken even has <code>compiler-typecase</code> to cover type dispatch <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a>.
  <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Types">Chicken has lots of things, really.</a>
  Magnificent times we live in—Scheme implementations reaching the level of big ones.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--other-lisps">Other Lisps: Common Lisp, Clojure</h3>

<p>
  Most of these things won't be a surprise after talking about how advanced Scheme implementations get.
  Still, doesn't hurt highlighting things that likely were an inspiration (from Common Lisp) and that enhance the state of art (in Clojure) of type/predicate checks.
</p>

<p>
  The main departure point for this library is Common Lisp.
  Having <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_assert.htm"><code>assert</code></a>
  and <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_check_.htm"><code>check-type</code></a>
  for <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>;
  <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_the.htm"><code>the</code></a>
  and <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_coerce.htm"><code>coerce</code></a> for <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>;
  <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_declar.htm"><code>declare</code></a>
  for <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a>;
  and <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_tpcase.htm"><code>(e|c|)typecase</code></a>
  (not even mentioning the object system and type-dispatched methods) for <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a>,
  it's covering most of what one needs with types/predicates.
  First-class-ish types, after all 🤷
</p>

<p>
  Clojure, while being restricted by JVM and functional design, has type annotations, conveniently allowing one to attach types to values <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>.
  It also has <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#_fn_name_param_condition_map_expr_2">pre/post conditions</a>
  for functions, allowing to check the argument validity <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a>.
  And, finally, there's <a href="https://clojure.org/news/2016/05/23/introducing-clojure-spec"><code>clojure.spec</code></a> that allows to define arbitrarily complex checks for data and match things to the contracts <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
  Lots of fun things.
